# Intro

Hi, I'm Divyansh. Currently, pursuing B.Tech CSE in NIIT University Also, I am the Co-founder and CTO of [NUmunch](https://numunch1-2.onrender.com/). I love to work on tools that have helped people over time. In my spare time, I invest in stocks and and also loves to listen ideas of people regarding Tech. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I was born with a crayon in hand. Writing on walls, desks, tables, and sometimes paper, and now digitally writing programs on a computer screen, Iâ€™ve been honing my abilities since I was an infant.

- Before college, I begged my parents to buy me a computer. But they said it was too expensive. So I made a deal with them and worked hard all summer to save up the money to buy one. 

- When I did, I spent the next month figuring out how to use Computer and write Programs on it (I may or may not have fallen asleep in school a time or two because I stayed up too late the night before learning to use programming.)

- Once I learned how to write Programs, I started making Apps, Websites, Chrome Extensions, etc. I was able to use these projects to land my first local job. 

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
